**The Media Skeptic’s Guide to Health BS**

**How to spot myths, misinformation, and marketing fluff in modern wellness culture**

---

In a time when articles are written for algorithms and headlines are crafted for rage-clicks, separating fact from fiction in health and wellness has never been harder. This isn’t because the public is dumb—far from it. It’s because fear, controversy, and magical thinking drive traffic, while nuance and scientific accuracy tend to get buried. This guide is for people who are tired of pseudoscience, health influencers with zero credentials, and "natural living" fads that are anything but natural.

Let's break down some of the most common myths that persist online, in conversations, and even in some supposedly well-meaning documentaries. You might be surprised how much of what you've heard is, well, total BS.

**Myth #1: Detox teas cleanse your body**

Nope. They don’t. Your body already has a top-tier detox system: it’s called your liver and kidneys. They work 24/7 to filter and eliminate waste. Detox teas often contain laxatives and diuretics, which just make you lose water weight and poop more. That’s not detoxing—that’s dehydration with branding. Real detox? Sleep well, drink water, and stop falling for Instagram ads with a leaf logo.

**Myth #2: Organic food is always healthier**

"Organic" doesn’t mean pesticide-free. It just means the pesticides used are "natural," which often means less effective and sometimes more toxic in larger doses. Nutritional differences between organic and conventional produce are negligible in most studies. What matters more is freshness, seasonality, and where your food comes from. A local apple sprayed once may be safer than an organic one flown in from across the world. And yes, even that apple has been genetically altered by humans over centuries. The Apple of Theseus.

**Myth #3: Microwaves destroy nutrients and make food radioactive**

Microwaves don’t destroy any more nutrients than any other cooking method. In fact, they often preserve more because of shorter cook times and minimal water use. They heat food by vibrating water molecules—which sounds intense but is just basic physics. Over-microwaved food may taste bad or get dry, but that’s due to evaporation, not radiation poisoning. And no, your food is not radioactive. Unless you microwaved uranium.

**Myth #4: Fasting is the best way to lose weight**

Occasional fasting for mental clarity or discipline is fine. But using it as a primary weight-loss strategy? Not so much. It often leads to muscle loss, binge cycles, or slowed metabolism. If you want to lose weight, focus on a sustainable calorie deficit and nutrient-dense foods that keep you full—think beans, veggies, lean protein. Want to burn fat? Eat less junk and walk more. Radical, I know.

**Myth #5: Fruit sugar is totally different from table sugar**

It’s not. Sugar is sugar—your body breaks it all down to glucose and fructose. But fruits come packaged with fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and water content that slow absorption and reduce sugar spikes. They also make you feel fuller. That’s why eating a banana is better than drinking a can of soda with the same sugar content. The problem isn’t sugar in fruit. It’s sugar in everything else pretending to be food.

**Myth #6: 5G, Bluetooth, or WiFi cause cancer**

They don’t. These are all non-ionizing radiation sources, meaning they don’t carry enough energy to damage DNA or cells. You’re more at risk of sunburn from the UV rays in sunlight than from your Bluetooth earbuds. Even your microwave oven emits non-ionizing radiation—the only danger there is overheating your pizza.

Fun fact: MRI machines use magnetic fields of several **teslas**, way stronger than Earth’s. Yet you walk out of the scan with nothing but a vague urge to Google your symptoms again.

**Myth #7: Crystals and magnets can heal you**

Placebo effect? Sure. Physical effect? Nah. Crystals are beautiful and magnets are awesome in motors and data storage, but healing properties? Not so much. Unless we’re talking about MRI machines or transcranial magnetic stimulation in controlled labs, magnets aren’t going to cure your arthritis. Still, it’s fun to charge your moonstone in the full moonlight if it makes you happy. Just don’t skip your meds.

**Myth #8: MSG is toxic**

MSG (monosodium glutamate) is just a flavor enhancer. It’s found naturally in foods like tomatoes, mushrooms, and parmesan cheese. The so-called "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome" started from a single letter to a journal in the 1960s and snowballed into a racist health panic. Most people metabolize MSG just fine. If you feel weird after eating it, it’s more likely from overeating or other ingredients. Also, MSG isn’t addictive. Your craving is just your taste buds enjoying themselves.

**Myth #9: You need 8 glasses of water a day**

There is no universal water quota. Hydration depends on your diet, climate, physical activity, and individual metabolism. You get a lot of water from food too (fruits, soups, rice). If your pee is light yellow, you’re good. Dark? Drink more. Also, you *can* overdose on water—it’s called **hyponatremia** and it’s rare but real. Fun toxicology trivia: the LD50 of water is about 90,000 mg/kg. So don’t chug six gallons to prove a point.

---

**Myth #10: Adults shouldn’t drink milk**

Lactose intolerance is common, but it’s not universal. Many adults continue to produce lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose. Milk is a good source of calcium, vitamin D, protein, and fats. Whether it comes from cows, oats, almonds, or a lab vat of yeast is up to you. Just maybe skip the human breast milk thing unless you have a *very* specific situation going on.

---

**Myth #11: Chemicals are dangerous — I want chemical-free products**

This is pure chemophobia. Everything is made of chemicals. Water is a chemical. Oxygen is a chemical. You are a chemical cocktail. Table salt is a great example: sodium explodes in water, chlorine is poisonous, but combined? Delicious. The dose makes the poison—even water, sugar, or oxygen can kill you at the wrong dose. So unless you're marketing to people who failed 9th grade science, stop saying "chemical-free."

---

**Myth #12: Frozen food is unhealthy**

Frozen fruits and veggies are often more nutritious than fresh ones, because they’re flash-frozen at peak ripeness. The texture may suffer if kept too long or improperly thawed, but the vitamins and minerals are still there. Plus, they reduce food waste and are often cheaper. Just don’t mistake a freezer-burned microwave burrito for healthy eating.

---

**Why these myths persist**

Because fear spreads faster than science. Because "natural" sounds safe. Because corporations have earned some mistrust. Because it's easier to believe in miracle fixes than to do boring things like eat more fiber and sleep. And because journalists need something to write about that will get shares, likes, and ad revenue.

**How to be a media skeptic without becoming a crank**

1. Ask who benefits. Are they selling something? Is it a supplement, a course, a book, a lifestyle brand?
2. Look for evidence, not vibes. Prefer peer-reviewed studies over TikTok testimonials.
3. Watch out for vague words like "boost," "cleanse," or "toxins."
4. Accept that science evolves. Updating facts isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s how knowledge works.
5. Be curious. Ask questions. But don’t check your brain at the door of a health food store.

---

**Conclusion: Use your brain, not your fear**

You don’t need a PhD to spot nonsense. Just a bit of logic, a little healthy skepticism, and the courage to say "uh, that doesn’t sound right." The internet is full of bad advice, but also good science—you just have to know where to look.

And next time someone tells you microwaves are dangerous, just smile and say, "Not unless you're standing inside one."

Stay sharp. Stay curious. And stay out of the clickbait.
