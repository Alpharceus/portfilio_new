Is the Universe a Simulation?
By Raman Pandey, 2025-05-11

From Nick Bostrom’s simulation argument to the limits of physical law, we ask: could reality be code?

The Simulation Hypothesis, in Brief
What if our universe is not “real” in the usual sense, but an incredibly complex simulation run by an advanced intelligence? Philosophers and physicists alike have taken this once-outlandish idea seriously in recent years, thanks in part to rapid advances in computing and artificial intelligence.

Nick Bostrom and the Trilemma
Bostrom’s famous argument boils down to three options:

Civilizations never reach technological maturity capable of simulating universes.

If they do, they don’t have any interest in running such simulations.

If they do—and they want to—then there are likely to be many simulated universes for every “real” one.

If #3 is true, statistically speaking, we might well be in one.

Is There Evidence?
Some physicists have proposed ways to “test” the simulation hypothesis, like looking for pixelation in the cosmic microwave background, or strange quantum effects that might hint at underlying code. So far, all we’ve found is more mystery.

Quantum Weirdness: Feature, Not Bug?
Quantum mechanics already tells us reality is “probabilistic,” and that observation seems to “collapse” possibilities into facts. Is this just how the universe works, or a sign that it’s all computation behind the scenes?

So, Are We Living in The Matrix?
Maybe. Maybe not. But as simulation tech advances, it gets harder to rule out the possibility. For now, the simulation hypothesis is less a theory and more a provocation: a reminder that reality is stranger—and more contingent—than we often realize.
